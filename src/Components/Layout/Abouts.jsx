           Hi! I'm Kamrul Biswas, a passionate MERN Stack Developer and dedicated freelancer with a strong love for building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6), React, and Redux, as well as backend technologies including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (Mongoose). With over a year of hands-on experience, I’m committed to delivering high-quality, functional websites and applications tailored to your needs and budget. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web development world. Whether it’s designing a sleek frontend interface or developing a robust backend system, I thrive on bringing ideas to life—from concept to deployment. When I’m not coding, I love exploring new tech trends and enhancing my skills to deliver even better solutions for my clients.
